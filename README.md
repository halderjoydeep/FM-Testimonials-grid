## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- jQuery

### What I learned

This is my first project using Grid layout. Grid is really so much powerful technique for layouting especially for two-dimensional layouting. Many developers try to avoid grid and use only flexbox, but that is not a good way as per my opinion. We have to use grid as well as flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xMQfnTU6oo) - Brad Traversy's youtube videos helped me in learning Grid technique. I'm really thankful to him. This project is included in that tutorial
